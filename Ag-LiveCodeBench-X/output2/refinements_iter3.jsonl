But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes.

Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\n\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\n\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$.

Otherwise, you lose.\n\nTo win this game, you will do the following cheat.\n\n- Freely rearrange the cards within a row whenever you want after step 1.\n\nYou are given two strings S and T, representing the two rows you have after step 1. Determine whether it is possible to win with cheating allowed.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\r\nT\n\nOutput\n\nIf it is possible to win with cheating allowed, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- S and T consist of lowercase English letters and @.\n- The lengths of S and T are equal and between 1 and 2\\times 10^5, inclusive.\n\nSample Input 1\n\nch@ku@ai\r\nchoku@@i\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYes\r\n\nYou can replace the @s so that both rows become chokudai.\n\nSample Input 2\n\nch@kud@i\r\nakidu@ho\n\nSample Output 2\n\nYes\r\n\nYou can cheat and replace the @s so that both rows become chokudai.\n\nSample Input 3\n\naoki\r\n@ok@\n\nSample Output 3\n\nNo\r\n\nYou cannot win even with cheating.\n\nSample Input 4\n\naa\r\nbb\n\nSample Output 4\n\nNo", "original_code": "#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char S[200001], T[200001];\n    scanf(\"%s\", S);\n    scanf(\"%s\", T);\n\n    int n = strlen(S);\n    int countS[26] = {0};\n    int countT[26] = {0};\n\n    // Count characters in S and T\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (S[i] != '@') {\n            countS[S[i] - 'a']++;\n        }\n        if (T[i] != '@') {\n            countT[T[i] - 'a']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Compare counts of non-'@' characters\n    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n        if (countS[i] != countT[i]) {\n            printf(\"No\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Yes\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}", "error_feedback": {"result": "fail:error", "exit_code": 1, "stdout": "", "stderr": "Compilation failed:\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c: In function 'main':\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:27:20: warning: missing terminating \" character\n   27 |             printf(\"No\n      |                    ^\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:27:20: error: missing terminating \" character\n   27 |             printf(\"No\n      |                    ^~~\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:28:1: warning: missing terminating \" character\n   28 | \");\n      | ^\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:28:1: error: missing terminating \" character\n   28 | \");\n      | ^~~\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:29:13: error: expected expression before 'return'\n   29 |             return 0;\n      |             ^~~~~~\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:29:22: error: expected ';' before '}' token\n   29 |             return 0;\n      |                      ^\n      |                      ;\n   30 |         }\n      |         ~             \n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:33:12: warning: missing terminating \" character\n   33 |     printf(\"Yes\n      |            ^\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:33:12: error: missing terminating \" character\n   33 |     printf(\"Yes\n      |            ^~~~\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:34:1: warning: missing terminating \" character\n   34 | \");\n      | ^\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:34:1: error: missing terminating \" character\n   34 | \");\n      | ^~~\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:36:5: error: expected expression before 'return'\n   36 |     return 0;\n      |     ^~~~~~\n/tmp/agnostics_c_aliwryh2/program.c:36:14: error: expected ';' before '}' token\n   36 |     return 0;\n      |              ^\n      |              ;\n   37 | }\n      | ~             \n"}, "refined_code": "#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n    char S[200001], T[200001];\n    scanf(\"%s\", S);\n    scanf(\"%s\", T);\n\n    int n = strlen(S);\n    int countS[26] = {0};\n    int countT[26] = {0};\n\n    // Count characters in S and T\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (S[i] != '@') {\n            countS[S[i] - 'a']++;\n        }\n        if (T[i] != '@') {\n            countT[T[i] - 'a']++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Compare counts of non-'@' characters\n    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n        if (countS[i] != countT[i]) {\n            printf(\"No\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the two rows of cards coincide after replacing '@' symbols\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (S[i] == '@' && T[i] == '@') {\n            continue;\n        }\n        if (S[i] == '@' || T[i] == '@') {\n            printf(\"No\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (S[i] != T[i]) {\n            printf(\"No\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Yes\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}", "reasoning": "The error in the original code is due to syntax errors in the printf statements.
