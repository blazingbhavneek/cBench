{"question_id": "1899_D", "language": "C", "problem_statement": "Yarik is a big fan of many kinds of music. But Yarik loves not only listening to music but also writing it.

But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes.

Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\n\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody.

The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\n\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes.
