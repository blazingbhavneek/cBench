{"question_id": "1899_D", "language": "C", "problem_statement": "Yarik is a big fan of many kinds of music. But Yarik loves not only listening to music but also writing it. He likes electronic music most of all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, is best for it.\n\nSince Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of $2^k$, where $k \\ge 1$\u00a0\u2014 a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes $(a, b)$, where $a = 2^k$ and $b = 2^l$, he denotes by the integer $a^b$.\n\nFor example, if $a = 8 = 2^3$, $b = 4 = 2^2$, then the combination $(a, b)$ is denoted by the integer $a^b = 8^4 = 4096$. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\n\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\n\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$. In other words, he wants to count the number of pairs $(i, j)$ $(i < j)$ such that $b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}$.

To fix this, we need to add a check to see if the sequence is already in the correct order before continuing the loop.

Specifically, the graph should only include edges between strings that differ by exactly one character, and the Eulerian path check should be adjusted to account for the fact that the sequence can start and end at any string, and it should have an even number of vertices with odd degrees (except for the start and end vertices). The provided test case 2 fails because the code incorrectly concludes that no valid sequence exists, when in fact a valid sequence does exist."}
